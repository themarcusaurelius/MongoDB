## Collects and parses the logs created by MongoDB

When you run this module, it performs a few tasks under the hood:

- Sets the default paths to the log files (but donâ€™t worry, you can override the defaults)
- Makes sure each multiline log event gets sent as a single event
- Uses ingest node to parse and process the log lines, shaping the data into a structure suitable for visualizing in Kibana
- Deploys dashboards for visualizing the log data

### Compatibility

The ```mongodb``` module was tested with logs from versions v3.2.11 on Debian.
